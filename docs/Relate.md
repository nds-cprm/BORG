from <https://objectbox.io/sqlite-alternatives/>

classic SQL: DB2, Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL

NonSQL: by Document: MongoDB and CouchDB; by Key-value: Redis and DynamoDB; by Wide-column: Cassandra and HBase; by Graph: Neo4j and Amazon Neptune

The five critical differences between SQL vs NoSQL are: <https://www.integrate.io/blog/the-sql-vs-nosql-difference/>

    SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.
    SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
    SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
    SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
    SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
    
" SQL was developed in the 1970s with a focus on reducing data duplication while NoSQL was developed in the late 2000s, 
  with a focus on scaling and allowing for rapid application change driven by agile and DevOps practices. ",
